# Folder Objects

This folder contains design patterns and **no cosmetics**.
* This is the first layer with class-based selector. It contains styles for non-cosmetic objects such as containers, wrappers and layout systems.
* It is mostly **layout-driven** and doesnâ€™t include anything cosmetic.
* This layer is perfect for **structural objects** and begins to use classes exclusively.  

* I actually named a header, navigation, main and footer as a **region**.

**If objects would be removed, the web site can fall into pieces. We would have a structural damage.**
