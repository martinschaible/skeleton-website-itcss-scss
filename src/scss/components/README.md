# Folder Components

Here we have designed and specific pieces of the UI. This is mostly a **cosmetic layer**.

* This is where specific styling instructions for objects can live.
* Without the components layer, the site would have its structure, but would look like a gray-box wireframe.
* Still only using classes.  

This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components.
It contains all kind of specific modules like sliders, widgets and basically anything along those lines.

In terms of creating a **theme**, this layer will hold the classes with the nice stuff.

**If Components would be removed, the web site does not fall into pieces.**
