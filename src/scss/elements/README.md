# Folder Elements

Styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.).
These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.

* Unclassed HTML elements: Element styles,â€Šbut no classes or IDs.
* Base typography styles go here, as well as anything needed to style raw elements.

**This is the last layer we see type selectors.**  

_Note: We are using a framework, which includes most of this things already._

**This folder holds only a few files to extend the framework or it remains empty.**
